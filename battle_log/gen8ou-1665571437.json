edge\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|i hate stone edge sometimes\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|Ferro is far more commonly used to check chomp than zap\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|yeah\n|c|\u2606broked on

on bricks|no contact 2x dmg vs zap\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|very appealing\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|right\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|esp since like\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|okay imagine this situation\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|player 1 brings in garchomp on heatran clicking stealth rock\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|player 2 brings in zapdos on chomp clicking stealth rock\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|having edge here gives immediate value\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|you remember how I switched around that sd chomp with the sand team yesterday?\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|predicting scale shot and going to Lele?\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|ye\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|yeah\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|scale shot is only for sweeping chomp\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|this one is a wallbreaker\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|ahhhh\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|it has scale shot so that if it's the right situation, you can use it endgame\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|but with the prevalence of rilla+weav, I think chomp gets revenge killed far too-easily\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|and so I'd rather nuke a flying type than worry about Ferro esp cos Ferro allows me to switch in any of my 3 fire types\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|that makes sense\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|that team is crazy tho in good matchups\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|at higher elo, that's especially valuable because there's more than 1 obvious switch that I might make, so my opponent can't double out and take back tempo\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|right\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|yeah do you want paste?\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|yeah sure\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|it's a little too gimick\/off-meta for me to recommend you practice with it, but it's strong\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|hahaha\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|yeah\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|it looks fun\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|at the end of the day tho, it's best to practice with whatever you like best\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|as long as you stick to it\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|oh yeah\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|free matchup vs stall and trick room\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|which makes it valuable in my eyes\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|true\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|stall is really hard to play against while you're still learning\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|I mean like while you're trying to get into high-mid elo\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|1300-1500\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|what would you consider like mid-high\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|1500+\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|ig\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|idk\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|high-middle elo I mean\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|high is like 1700+\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|gothca\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|that's arbitrary but\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|my point is that you need specific understanding about sequences; beating stall is all about thinking 15 turns ahead\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|yeah\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|but not just generally, you need to have a really concrete plan to break their defensive cores before turn 1\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|is there any legitrimate anti stall tech thats consistent\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|with this team tho eruption in sun does 70-80 vs. physical pex\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|yeah there's heaps\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|what style of team?\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|hm\n|c|\u2606Mrgamb1er007|idek\n|c|\u2606broked on bricks|your team is incredibly consistent in the stall
